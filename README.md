# Ice Cream Shop Revenue Prediction depending upon the Temperature.</b></p>
I used Decision Tree Regressor Model for the Prediction of data in this project. 
</b>.
<br>So the dataset of a Ice Cream Shop contains:
<li>"Temperature" is independent variable
<li>"Revenue" is dependent variable
<br>And for better accuracy I used Linear Regression Model.
